This is a collection of historical data I transcribed or digitized during my research.

It is pretty much still a work in progress (and probably always will be)

Full, standardized metadata are available for the Statistics, while they are lacking for most Maps. 
I'll include them when I've time. Please ask for detailed metadata if you intend to use anything: wilko.hardenberg@gmail.com or @wilkohardenberg
